# sheet-sql-report
Inspired by a need for this kind of inter-functionality I've seen in my own work, this is python package to help anyone to make use of their data stored in google sheets and SQL databases.


To install simply use `pip install sheet-to-sql`

Then to use in your project simply import using `import sheet_sql_report`
